## SkewC

This is an R Markdown document to create the required coverage matrixes. The input is the vector of the normalized values from the genebody coverge script (coverage.r)file. In this file, each single-cell has a vector of numerical values. The each cell has a cell id with prefix SCC_


```{r load required libraries}
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```
## 

```{r Read the input gene body coverage vector file .r}
## Source the coverage.r file
source(file = "coverage.r")
## In put the dataset title. The dataset title will be used
## to label the output plots
DatasetTitle <- readline(prompt = "What is the dataset title?")
```

##
```{r Creat list var}
## Initation of the initiation of variables and coverageValues
## list
vars <- ls(pattern = "SCC_")
nvars <- length(vars)
CoverageValues <- list()
j <- 1
for (i in 1:nvars)
{
if (class(get(vars[i])) == "numeric")
{
CoverageValues[[j]] <- get(vars[i])
names(CoverageValues)[j] <- vars[i]
j <- j + 1
}
}
```
##
```{r Create R data frame of the coverage matrix}
## The data frame name Coverage_DF
## Coverage_DF consists of 100 columns [pmean1..pmean100] plus the ## cell ID column "Annotation"


Coverage_DF <- as.data.frame(t(as.data.frame(CoverageValues)))
Coverage_DF$Annotation <- rownames(Coverage_DF)
rownames(Coverage_DF) <- NULL

## Remove the prefix string from the Coverage_means_DF
dfv <- as.character('SCC_')
Coverage_DF$Annotation <- gsub(dfv, "", Coverage_DF$Annotation)
## Remove the prefix string from the Coverage_means_DF


```

```{r }
## Compute the mean coveage matrix Coverage_means_DF
## The data frame name Coverage_means_DF
## Coverage_means_DF consists of 10 columns [pmean10..pmean100] plus the ## cell ID column "Annotation"
