## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r required R libraries}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(reshape2)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
