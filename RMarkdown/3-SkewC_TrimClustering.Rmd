## Skewc

This is an R Markdown document to perform tirm clustering. The input to this script was the R data frame (Coverage_means_DF_Clust) from 
1.	1-SkewC_Create_Coverage_Matrix.Rmd

```{r load required libraries}
library(tclust)
## Enter the initial value for alpha (outliter triming)
## Alpha range between [0..1]
Alpha_ini <- readline(prompt = "What is Alpha?")
```

## 

##
```{r apply trim clustering}
Coverage_means_DF_Clust_Annotation <- Coverage_means_DF_Clust
Coverage_means_DF_Clust$Annotation <- NULL
trimClust <- function(x) {
  clus <- tclust (
    Coverage_means_DF_Clust,
    k = 1,
    alpha = as.numeric(Alpha_ini),
    restr.fact = 1,
    restr = "eigen",
    equal.weights = TRUE
  )
  result <- clus
  return(result)
}
trimClustResult <- trimClust(x)

```
##
```{r Plot the clustring result}
pdf(paste("./",DatasetTitle,"CLUSTResult.pdf"))
plot(
trimClustResult,
main = list(
  paste(DatasetTitle,"(n=", NROW(Coverage_DF),")","\n","cells clustering by gene body coverage"),
cex = 1.5,
col = "black",
font = 2
)
)
box(lty = "solid", col = 'black', lwd = 3)
axis(
side = 1,
lwd = 2,
lwd.ticks = 4,
col.ticks = "black"
)
axis(
side = 2,
lwd = 3,
lwd.ticks = 4,
col.ticks = "black"
)
dev.off()

```

```{r save clustering results as text file and data frame}
