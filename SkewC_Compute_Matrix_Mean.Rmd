## Skewc

This is an R Markdown document to creduce coverage matrix (bin size 100 > 10). The input is the R data frame E_MTAB_2600Coverage_means_DF. 

```{r Create var}
p10 <- c('pmean1','pmean2','pmean3','pmean4','pmean5','pmean6','pmean7','pmean8','pmean9','pmean10')
p20 <- c('pmean11','pmean12','pmean13','pmean14','pmean15','pmean16','pmean17','pmean18','pmean19','pmean20')  
p30 <- c('pmean21','pmean22','pmean23','pmean24','pmean25','pmean26','pmean27','pmean28','pmean29','pmean30')  
p40 <- c('pmean31','pmean32','pmean33','pmean34','pmean35','pmean36','pmean37','pmean38','pmean39','pmean40')
